# Smartthings

This is a place where I store SmartThings apps that I use around our house.  If you see something that might be of use to you, please feel free to use or modify it.  If you use it or modify it, let me know.  I would love to hear how others are using my code.  I am on the SmartThings community forums as "Oldcomputerwiz".

I am very new at Groovy so some of the code that I have written may not be  "up to snuff" or just plain BAD.  If you are a groovy programmer, I would be more than happy for someone to show me how to make my code better.  My coding experience goes back over 30 years ago and involved using BASIC.  I started on a TRS80 and moved to Commodores, Sinclairs and eventually IBM PC's and their clones.  

I also did some industrial programming using "Relay Ladder Logic", mainly boolean, on Texas Instruments and Eagle Signal programmable controlers.

Thanks for looking around.

Steve
